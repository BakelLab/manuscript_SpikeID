### **Figure 1**

To generate the SNPs for the S region for the variants of concern (VOCs), the `manuscript_SpikeID` conda environment must be loaded as it includes the tool, [`snipit`](https://github.com/aineniamh/snipit). Alternatively, the bash script checks if it is installed, installing it using `pip` if it isn't. The file `nextclade_vocs.aligned.S.renamed.fasta` must exist in the `FASTAs` directory. This nextclade FASTA file is generated by ???????????. Then, simply running the [`run-snipit.sh`](https://github.com/BakelLab/manuscript_SpikeID/blob/main/figures/figure1/scripts/run-snipit.sh) script which is found in `figures/figure1/scripts` generates the corresponding PDF and CSV files, storing them in `figures/figure1/figures` as 

**<u>Output:</u>**

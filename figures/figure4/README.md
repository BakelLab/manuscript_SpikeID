### Figure 4

The generation of the last main figure for the paper can be done using the [script](https://github.com/BakelLab/manuscript_SpikeID/blob/main/figures/figure4/scripts/figure4_LineageFrequencies.R) that plots the lineages frequency per method. 
The source data `figures/figure4/data/figure4.csv` is needed to generate a plot displaying the lineages at different frequencies over time for each of the datasets, those being GISAID-NY, PSP combined, WGS only, and SpikeID only.
A list of GISAID accession numbers used for the analysis can be found at `figures/figure4/data/GISAID_NY_Accessions.csv`
